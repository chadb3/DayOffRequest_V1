php -S localhost:8000

use the above to start a local instance

in an Internet Browser, navigate to "localhost:8000"

Note: using the above, there will be less commits, even to dev. The reason for many of the commits was troubleshooting CSS and php code. I would need to push a new build and pull it onto my Ubuntu Server with Apache just to test.

Now that I know about this command that won't be necessary.
